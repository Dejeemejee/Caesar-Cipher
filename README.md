# Caesar-Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts letters in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. It's one of the simplest encryption methods, though not secure for modern use. It's named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it for secret communication.
